## D&D 5e Abjuration Wizard Features

This tracker is specifically designed to work with:
- **Arcane Ward** (Level 2 Abjuration Wizard feature)
- Various **temporary HP** sources (tracked as "Shielding Reservoir")
- Your character's **actual HP**

The damage order follows D&D 5e rules where temporary HP and wards are depleted before actual HP.
